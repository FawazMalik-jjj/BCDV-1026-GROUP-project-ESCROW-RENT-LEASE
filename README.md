# ESCROW-RENT-LEASE



The is a smart contract that has been deployed and designed to solve rental lease and escrow payments. 
The aim of this smart contract code is to facilitate a rental escrow system with additional functionality for calculating reliability scores for tenants. The contract allows tenants to create escrow agreements with landlords by specifying the escrow ID, rent amount, and lease duration. Tenants can mark the escrow as leased and make rent payments to the escrow account. Landlords have the ability to end or cancel leases, transferring the escrow balance back to themselves.
The contract introduces the concept of reliability scores, enabling tenants to calculate and update their own scores. The reliability score calculation takes into account factors such as the tenant's lease agreement and payment history (to be implemented separately). This score provides an assessment of the tenant's reliability, which can be useful for future rental agreements.
